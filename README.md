# Study_Schedule_Generator

The purpose of this web application is to help students create a study schedule that maximizes their efficiency and productivity. By inputting the number of subjects they need to study and the number of days they have to study, the application will generate a personalized schedule that takes into account the priority level of each subject.

The goals of the project are to provide students with a tool that:

Helps them allocate their study time in a way that is most effective for their individual needs.

Prioritizes the subjects they need to study based on their importance, difficulty level, and upcoming exams or assignments.

Provides a visual representation of their study schedule that they can easily follow and adjust as needed.

Allows them to customize their schedule by adding breaks, shifting study times, or rearranging subjects.

Can be accessed from any device with an internet connection, making it convenient and accessible for students on-the-go.

By achieving these goals, the web application aims to help students stay on track with their studies, reduce stress and anxiety, and improve their academic performance.
